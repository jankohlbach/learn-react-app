 *🏆
 * This component is similar to what we looked at for the exercise of `Understanding Props`
 * section (./04-Props.js) but there are some differences.
 *  We expect the user of this component to pass `stockTicker` as props.
 * But one difference here compared to earlier exercise is that we are not expecting `companyProfileInfo`
 * to be passed as props. Instead we have an API that we would like to use to
 * fetch the data from. It has a method called `getCompanyProfile(ticker)`
 * that will return you `companyProfile` for given ticker.
 * The goal is to help you understand some use cases where we might want to use
 * some of the React lifecycle methods

    /**
     * ✏️ 
     * We need to use componentDidMount lifecycle method to fetch company profile
     * information for given stock ticker using the DataAPI provided
     * 🧭  Add lifecycle method called componentDidMount
     * 🧭  Inside that method you need to use the DataAPI that's already imported.
     *     Make a call to `getCompanyProfile()` method and pass the `stockTicker` from the props.
     *     This method will return a promise that resolves into `companyProfile` info
     * 🧭  Using the data from the promise use `setState` to set companyProfileInfo
     *    like - `this.setState({ companyProfileInfo: data })`
     * 🧭  What if the promise resolves into an error? You might want to catch the error
     *     and do something with it (Remember .catch in Promise). For example below I'm
     *     catching an error and just logging it in console. You can do the same for the
     *     sake of this exercise:
     *          Api.getData()
     *             .then(data => doSth(data))
     *             .catch(error => console.log(error))
